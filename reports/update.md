# `r/place`
## Chris Allum, Maya Sivanandan, Berwin Lan

### Project Goals
We were inspired by the subreddit `r/place`, which was a canvas where users could click on a pixel and change its color every 5 minutes. We plan on using networking and the `ncurses` library for the GUI to recreate this functionality on a much smaller and more basic canvas. For our lower bound, we are creating an interface where a client can connect to a server and use arrow keys to fill pixels. Additional goals include multiple clients connecting and editing the canvas, a 5-minute timer, and using the mouse cursor instead of arrow keys to select pixels and colors.

### Learning Goals
* working with threading and semaphores
* more advanced networking than both our Project 1s
* an interactive and engaging project

### Project Resources
* Chapter 11 in Griffiths, D. (2012). Head First C. Oâ€™Reilly Media.
* [Beej's guide to network programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)
* `ncurses` documentation
