I'm going to assume that one computer will serve as the host. From there, each other compuuter
will connect to the host via a socket. The host will then send out board states

from one ./main code

1) init board by ./main -host

host will split out ip? or something like that
the main will not be able to do anything

2) join by ./main -join ip

by running ./main as a join, it will create a thread and fork the main code into the code 
designated for those who are just playing game.
